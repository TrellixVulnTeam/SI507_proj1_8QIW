**SI507F17 Project Number 1**

_Summary_

Created a testing suite for the file SI507F17_project1_cards.py. Used as our first foray into using unittest module on Python.


_What does SI507F17_project1_cards.py do?_

Simulates two virtual computers playing the classic card game of War. The file was given to us by the instructor. The code contains at least 3 bugs.


_What does this test suite do?_

Runs through a set of tests to find these bugs. The project came with a .txt file with English description of what each element of the code should be doing-- the tests were created to adhere to these specifications. 


_What do I need to run this?_

Python, at least version 3. You'll also need the helper_functions.py (included in this directory), to run the SI507F17_project1_cards.py file. You'll also need to download the following libraries, if they're not already a part of the Python package:
-requests
-json
-random
-webbrowser
